I've always been sort of a daydreamer growing up. But never imagined I would feel stuck in a job doing the same boring thing day in and day out. My dream job was a job that allowed me to create, think and be challenged. Not organizing files for three years. 

I worked in the mortgage department for a well-known bank and at first, I thought that this would be change from customer service and I'll be able to enjoy new challenges. As soon as I started, little did I know that layoffs were going to happen. Not even six months on the job and the first layoffs were done. Thank God I was not one of them, but everyday going in to work, my manager wasn't sure if she had a job. I wanted a more stable job. I needed a stable career. I started looking for another job or even a different dept but my search was long and difficult to say the least. While searching, I saw an article for 10 best jobs and I remember seeing Software engineer was number one. I searched the internet looking at how would I get started with something like this. I was moved and that's when the desire started. I checked out udemy.com and treehouse and started learning a few things and I loved the ability to create, be challenged. I had my “Aha” moment and thought let’s make this my career goal.

I moved back home for personal reasons and once again my job search was limited and location did not help my case. So, after a year of being unemployed and still not getting all the information I needed for a successful start in development, I took a job as a customer service rep working for an internet company. Thinking that this would help get my foot in the door but it seemed to derail me instead. Unhappy once again with a job with no growth, I decided that I would not prolong my dream job any longer. After four months I decided to quit my job and enroll at Flatiron School for Web Development. 

That was the best decision I ever made.
